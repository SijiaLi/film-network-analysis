# Film Network Analysis

This project is a collaboration between BU MSSP consulting team, Fangjing and me to be specific, and our client, a PhD candidate from BU College of Communication. The purpose is to find the overlap between viewership for different genres of film.

Fangjing and I focused on getting clusters of viewers using community detection and try to make sense of each community. 
For now we're comparing the results from 2 community detection, with viewing ratings info included in the community detection and without, and try to make sense the community's attitude (positive or negative) if ratings are incorporated. You can take a glimpse of the progress [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ThchOYbFmnBwLfmdU7OO0j_7PMhLH2TudQ3UL1K3dF8/edit?usp=sharing). 


The project is a long term collaboration from Fall 2016 and is still ongoing. An academic paper is expected.
